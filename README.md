# Smart_Garden_System
The Smart Garden System is an IoT-based project designed to automate the management of garden conditions, ensuring optimal growth for plants. This system utilizes various sensors to monitor soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and light levels, enabling efficient resource management and promoting sustainable gardening practices.
## Project Overview
The Smart Garden System allows users to:
- Monitor temperature and humidity levels using the DHT11 sensor.
- Track soil moisture content to optimize watering schedules.
- Control an external device (like a water pump) based on soil moisture levels.
- Display sensor readings on an LCD for easy monitoring.
- Communicate with the system via Bluetooth for remote access.

## Hardware Requirements
- Arduino Uno or compatible microcontroller
- DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor
- Soil Moisture Sensor
- Relay Module
- LCD Display (16x2)
- HC-05 Bluetooth Module
- Jumper Wires
- Breadboard or PCB
- Power Supply (e.g., 9V battery or USB power)
